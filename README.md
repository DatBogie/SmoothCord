# SmoothCord <img src="./SmoothCordLogo.png" height="25">
A *very* simple Discord theme aimed at animating clickable elements.
Targetting Vencord; BetterDiscord is and will (likely) remain untested.<br>

> [!Note]
> ThemePreview is not perfect; there are various things that the real SmoothCord theme does that aren't visible via the preview.

[**Preview Theme**](https://gibbu.github.io/ThemePreview/?file=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DatBogie/SmoothCord@refs/heads/main/SmoothCord.theme.css) via Gibbu's [ThemePreview](https://github.com/Gibbu/ThemePreview)

# Installation
> [!Warning]
> Compatability with other themes is not guaranteed by any means; **this theme will not work with certain themes**. I have tested SmoothCord with SkeuoCord, and found that certain buttons (namely the `User Settings`, `Deafen`, and `Mute` buttons) fail to animate.

To install, do as you would with any other Vencord theme:
1. [**Download Above**](https://github.com/DatBogie/SmoothCord?tab=readme-ov-file#-download-here-) `SmoothCord.theme.css`.
2. Navigate to your themes folder (Typically `~/.config/Vencord/themes` on Linux, `%APPDATA%\Vencord\themes` on Windows). Alternatively, open Discord, go to `User Settings > Themes` and click `Open Themes Folder`.
3. Cut/paste `SmoothCord.theme.css` into the foremention folder.
4. Open `User Settings` in Discord, and navigate to the `Themes` tab.
5. If you do not see `SmoothCord`, simply click the `Load missing Themes` button, and it should appear!
